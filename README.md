This manuscript is in review.

This repository includes code for data processing/bioinformatics (directories: "CodeProcessing_Bacteria" and "CodeProcessing_Fungi") as well as for analysis ("Code"). Downloading and using the R Project will help set the working directory in Rstudio. The "phy_object" folders contain the phyloseq objects (containing OTU matricies, taxonomy tables, and meta data) that are called on in the code for analyses.

## Abstract
Understanding the factors influencing microbial community composition in the rhizosphere is an important step towards managing the microbiomes of globally important crops like potato (Solanum tuberosum). Potato is vegetatively propagated and seed tubers are planted with tare soil, or soil adhering to the tuber surface, from their field of origin. Bulk soil is known to influence rhizosphere microbiome composition, but whether tare soil additionally contributes to compositional variation is not known. We tested the hypothesis that tare soil influences rhizosphere microbiome composition in a greenhouse experiment where tare soil was removed (or remained intact for controls) prior to planting in either an agricultural or non-agricultural soil. We used ITS and 16S metabarcoding to characterize the fungal and bacterial rhizosphere communities of plants grown from the experimental seed tubers. We found that tare soil influenced rhizosphere microbial composition, but more strongly for fungi than bacteria. As expected, bulk soil origin explained the greatest amount of variation in the rhizosphere microbiome overall, but we found no evidence that the impact of tare soil on microbial community composition differed between bulk soil origins. The magnitude of the tare soil effect did, however, depend in part on seed tuber origin. Our findings reveal that tare soil explains a significant, though modest, amount of variation in rhizosphere composition, and sets the stage for future work addressing functional consequences for plant health and productivity.
